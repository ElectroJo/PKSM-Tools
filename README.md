## serveLegality-CLI

This is a semi-rollback of serveLegality that instead of accepting files over IP, it accepts them directly.
I modified this for a script that im working on for an up-comming multi battle in my town, in which all the pokemon are randomized.
USAGE: serveLegality.exe (Input file) (Output file)
